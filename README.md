# To-Do App

## Requirements / Purpose

-   The MVP is to create the front end of a To-Do App that allows you to track, add and delete tasks, as well as manage categories of tasks.
-   The purpose of the project is to develop skills in and develop an app using a Typescript React framework.
-   The stack used is Typescript, React (Vite) and Styled Components for CSS, with Vitest for unit testing

---

## Build Steps

-   Pull repo from main branch. To install node modules:

```
npm install
```

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I have focused on implementing one feature at a time, before moving onto the next. As categories has a many-to-one relationship with tasks, I focused on being able to add and store categories as the initial step, before moving onto adding and manipulating tasks.
-   This is my first time using Typescript in an individual project and Typescript within a React framework. Through building the project, I aim to further develop my skills in both Typescript and React.
-   I have used Styled Components for the first time in a project, to learn more about its use and benefits. I have created basic styling components and will complete the styling for the app as my last step.
